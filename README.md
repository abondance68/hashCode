 # Hashcode <br>
 
 The user will be prompted in the CLI to enter his name or any name he/she chooses.<br>
 Each letter of the name will then be converted into its ASCII code.<br>
 Once each letter is transformed into its number in ASCII , all the generated numbers are added and this  sum is then divided by 100.<br>
 We chose 100 because it is the size of the array in which we will store the name into in the case of a hash table.<br>
 The resulting hash will always be , in this case, an integer between 0 & 99.<br>
