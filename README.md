 # Hashcode <br>
 
 The user will be prompted in the CLI to enter his name or any name he/she chooses. 
 Each letter of the name will then be converted into its ASCII code. 
 Once each letter is transformed into its number in ASCII , all the generated numbers are added and this  sum is then divided by 100.
 We chose 100 because it is the size of the array in which we will store the name into in the case of a hash table . 
 The resulting hash will alwyas be , in this case, between 0 & 99.
